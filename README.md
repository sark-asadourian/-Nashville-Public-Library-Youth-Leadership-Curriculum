Here is the intro:
This toolkit was built to aid in the consistent creation of innovative, feasible, and impactful youth lead projects. The toolkit uses several evidence-based practices to accomplish this. The first is Direct Instruction which uses metacognition, scaffolding, and independent practice to build the youthâ€™s skills to create a successful project. A core principle of this toolkit is foundational skills, like generating ideas, must be in place before higher order tasks can be undertaken, like creating change in the community. Harmony SEL curriculum is integrated into youth lead projects to build foundational interpersonal skills. Lessons are organized to teach key skills with Harmony SEL, followed by the youth applying the skills to the youth lead project. CW-FIT is a positive reinforcement behavior management system which creates a positive learning environment. 

This toolkit was originally designed for High Schoolers, but it can be adapted to fit many programs.

The lessons written so far create a foundation for youth led projects. As any contractor knows a strong foundation is key to building a house. Scaffolding is provided in the goals and timeline pages. The goals identify foundational skill and levels of proficiency. These goals are useful in planning lessons and assessing achievement. The timeline details the order and time for each step of developing a youth lead project. The existing lessons can model how these lessons should be conducted.
